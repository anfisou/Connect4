This project was developed for the subject 'Artificial Intelligence' by the students [Andr√© Sousa](https://github.com/anfisou) and [Paulo Silva](https://github.com/Panda-Hacks) and implements a Connect 4 game against an opponent that can play using different algorithms. 
You can choose between the Minimax, the Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms.

In order to execute the game you need to compile all the .java files using:
```
javac *.java
```

To run the code you only need to execute one of the following commands:
- ```java Jogo4Linha Minimax ```
- ```java Jogo4Linha MinimaxAlphaBeta ```
- ```java Jogo4Linha MonteCarlo ```
